title: I/O Utilities
---

The following assumes you are in the `run()` method of an oclif [command](commands.md).

### this.log(message: string)

Output message to stdout.

```typescript
this.log('hello, world!')
```

Common I/O utilities are provided via [cli-ux](https://github.com/oclif/cli-ux). These don't necessarily have to be used with oclif if you'd like to use them in another project.

**TODO: Finish this bit**
