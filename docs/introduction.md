This tutorial is a step-by-step guide to introduce you to oclif. If you have not developed anything in a command line before, this tutorial is a great place to get started.

### Before you begin

oclif is written in Node. You'll need Node as well as npm, which is a package manager for Javascript and a software registry. 

If you do not have them already, follow the [instructions here to install npm and Node together](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

### Single-command or Multi-command

First you need to decide if you want a single- or multi-command CLI. A [single-command CLI](single.md) does one action and is like `ls` or `curl`. A [multi-command CLI](multi.md) does many actions and is more like `git` or the Heroku CLI.
