title: Topics

As Multi CLIs grow it can be useful to nest commands within topics. This is supported simply by placing command files in subdirectories. For example, with the Heroku CLI we have a topic `heroku config` with commands like `heroku config`, `heroku config:set` and `heroku config:get`. The directory structure looks like this:

```
package.json
src/
└── commands/
    └── config/
        ├── index.ts
        ├── set.ts
        └── get.ts
```

The help descriptions will be the description of the first command within a directory. If you'd like to customize the help description, add it to the `package.json` like so:

```js
{
  "oclif": {
    "topics": {
      "apps:favorites": { "description": "manage favorite apps" },
      "config": { "description": "manage heroku config variables" },
    }
  }
}
```

Subtopics can be created by making subdirectories within topic directories, but for UX reasons we generally discourage going more than 1 or 2 levels deep even for the largest CLIs.
