title: Announcing oclif v2!
---

Hello and happy new year! It is our great pleasure to announce that with the turn of a new year we have finally released oclif v2 which uses the new [@oclif/core](https://github.com/oclif/core) library! ðŸŽ‰

oclif v2 includes many changes that improve the experience of both creating and using an oclif CLI.

Going forward we do not plan to make any updates to oclif v1 and its corresponding libraries except for critical security fixes (please see the [compatibility matrix](#Compatibility-Matrix) for a list of these libraries). We are not completely dropping support yet in order to give developers time to migrate from v1 to v2 but at some point in the future we will archive v1 repositories and deprecate their versions on NPM.

## Whatâ€™s changing?

### Repository Changes

All repositories under the [oclif org](https://github.com/oclif/) now use `main` as their primary branch and `oclif-v1` as the legacy branch. The `main`  branch corresponds to oclif v2 and the `oclif-v1` branch to oclif v1. If you find any repos that donâ€™t have a `main` branch you can safely assume that they are not used in oclif v2 and will be deprecated at some point in the future.

### Consolidating Tools & Libraries

The [`oclif-dev`](https://github.com/oclif/dev-cli) CLI has now been incorporated into [`oclif`](https://github.com/oclif/oclif). Now you no longer need to install a separate package to manage your entire CLIâ€™s lifecycle.

The following libraries have been consolidated under [`@oclif/core`](https://github.com/oclif/core) and will be deprecated at some point in the future. You can read the [migration guide](https://github.com/oclif/core/blob/main/MIGRATION.md) to see how to update your CLI or plugin to use the new core library.

* `@oclif/command`
* `@oclif/config`
* `@oclif/error`
* `@oclif/help`
* `@oclif/parser`

### No more single vs multi command CLIs

There is only 1 "type" of oclif v2 CLI but it can have as few or as many commands as a developer wants. This also means thereâ€™s only one command for generating CLIs, `oclif generate ` as opposed to the old `oclif single` and `oclif multi` commands.

### Node > 12

In order to ensure oclif CLIs are as secure as possible all v2 libraries and plugins only support Node 12 or higher as of now and, going forward, will only be supporting Node Maintenance or higher as defined by Node's release schedule here: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/.

## Whatâ€™s new?

### New example CLI

[`oclif-hello-world`](https://github.com/oclif/hello-world/) is our new example repo. This is also the repo that is [used as a template](https://github.com/oclif/oclif/blob/edc6616e51/src/generators/cli.ts#L74) when running `oclif generate` to create a new CLI. This repo will always be able to be referenced as an example of what an oclif v2 CLI should look like.

### Spaced commands

oclif CLIs can now use spaces to separate topics and subcommands instead of colons. To enable this feature simply add `â€œtopicSeparator": " "` to the oclif config in your package.json. You can see an example of this in our [example repo](https://github.com/oclif/hello-world/blob/main/package.json#L55).

```
// Old commands that use :
$ mycli do:something
```
```
// New spaced commands
$ mycli do something
```

> Note: Spaced commands are backwards compatible so if you enable spaced commands for your CLI users will still be able to use `:` as a separator. This ensures that any existing scripts are not broken.

### New Help Output

Weâ€™ve revamped the way help for commands is output to the terminal to make it both easier to implement and easier to read. You can see the difference between the old help output on the left and the new help output on the right in the screenshots down below.

<table border="0">
 <tr>
    <td>oclif v1</td>
    <td>oclif v2</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
    <td><img src="../static/img/2022-01-12-announcing-oclif-v2/sfdx-help.png"/></td>
    <td><img src="../static/img/2022-01-12-announcing-oclif-v2/sf-help.png"/></td>
 </tr>
</table>

Youâ€™ll notice that there are new sections for flags and global flags, examples are displayed with better spacing, and there is a section at the bottom called Configuration Variables. The Configuration Variables section is not part of the new help by default but we now have support for custom help sections which is what the `sf` CLI uses to create it.

### Async Command Parsing

Weâ€™ve also improved the performance of new CLIs by rewriting how commands are parsed on initialization. The [new parser](https://github.com/oclif/core/blob/main/src/parser/parse.ts) is asynchronous which makes CLIs with a lot of commands or installed  plugins much faster.

## Whatâ€™s coming?

Part of our charter for the release of oclif v2 includes improving our engagement with the oclif community. We know that over the past couple of years weâ€™ve reduced our involvement and a lot of issues and PRs have languished in limbo. Hopefully youâ€™ve already seen increased activity and responses from oclif maintainers recently but if you havenâ€™t please donâ€™t hesitate to ping us by tagging [@admins](https://github.com/orgs/oclif/teams/admins) in oclif repos.

We also want to start interviewing members of the oclif community to acquire feedback and prioritize the features and fixes you deem most important!

Best,

The oclif team

#### Migration Guide

This guide explains how to upgrade a CLI or plugin from the old oclif v1 libraries to the new `@oclif/core` library oclif v2 uses.

#### Compatibility Matrix

The following matrix shows how the v1 libraries and plugins relate to the new ones for v2. You can use this as a guide to know what to drop and which versions to switch when upgrading your plugins and CLIs to v2.
